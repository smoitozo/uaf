The User Attribute Fetcher (UAF) is modular middleware application for fetching user attribute information from PHP applications like [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org). The UAF comes with modules for making requests to the UAF from other applications like [simpleSAMLphp](http://www.simplesamlphp.org).

This project is inspired by the [Drupal Role Fetcher (DRF)](http://code.google.com/p/drupalrolefetcher/), which focuses on fetching only user roles from Drupal. This project will expand the DRF to support different applications for user management (WordPress, Moodle, etc) as well as allowing authorized agents to request more information about users than just roles.
