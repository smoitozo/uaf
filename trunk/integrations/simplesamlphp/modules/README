The drupalrolefetcher module for simpleSAMLphp provides the 
drupalrolefetcher:AddRolesFromDrupal authentication processing filter.

INSTALLATION
This auth proc can be activated by moving the drupalrolefetcher directory
to the modules directory of your simpleSAMLphp installation. 

CONFIGURATION
To use the AddRolesFromDrupal auth proc you can add a configuration
stanza to a metadata configuration or to config.php under authproc.sp or
authproc.idp. For more on this see the documentation at 
http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.8/simplesamlphp-authproc

Here is an example configuration stanza for authproc.sp in config.php

        'authproc.sp' => array(

                40 => array(
                        'class' => 'drupalrolefetcher:AddRolesFromDrupal',
                        'drf_url' => 'https://www.example.org/drf/',
                        'drf_sharedsec' => '1234567890abcdefghijklm',
                        'drf_user_identifier' => 'eduPersonPrincipalName',
                        'new_attribute_name' => 'wwwexamplecomroles',
                        ),

        ),

With this stanza in place simpleSAMLphp will execute the AddRolesFromDrupal
every time a user logs in, regardless of the IdP they use for authentication.
It will query the Drupal Role Fetcher at https://www.example.org/drf/ using
the configured shared secret, which was issued by the DRF at www.example.org.
When the auth proc queries the DRF it will pass the value of 
eduPersonPrincipalName for the current user. The DRF will look up the roles
for the user and return them to the auth proc, which will insert them into
a new identity attribute called wwwexamplecomroles.
